## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a Pet Adoption app UI, built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

## Features
### The app contains an overview screen that displays a list of pets, and a detail screen showing each pet's details.
These screens use prepoulated dummy data and compose different custom `Composable` functions.
- Use `Row` and `Column` to arrange the contents of the UI, the style setting.
- Add `TopAppBar`
- Use `Material` `Typography` to style the text
- Use `elevation` to make the Cards stand out from the background
- Use Navigation component, with passing arguments to a destination
- Use `LazyColumn` and `LazyRow` to show how only visible items are loaded into the list
- Use `painterResource` to load image drawable resources
- Use `Layout` to show [VerticalGrid](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/blob/main/Jetsnack/) of two columns
- Use `Box` with `ScrollState`, simulate [Collapsible Toolbar](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/blob/main/Jetsnack/)
- Use of [`FilterChip`](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/blob/main/Jetsnack/) to show filters
- Use `CircleShape` to display images
